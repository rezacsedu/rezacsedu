**Who am I?**

I'm an Applied & Data Scientist with 11 years of experience adept and experienced at: i) analyzing large-scale datasets, ii) developing accurate predictive models, iii) applying advanced analytical methods to deliver actionable insights, iv) implementing data-driven solutions to complex business and research problems, and v) making them interpretable. I hold B.Sc. (University of Dhaka, Bangladesh) and M.Sc. (Kyung Hee University, Korea) degrees in Computer Science. Before joining Fraunhofer FIT, I worked as a Data Science Researcher at Insight Centre for Data Analytics, Ireland. Even before that, I worked as a Lead Engineer at Samsung Electronics, Korea. I'm also a PhD candidate at RWTH Aachen University, under the supervision of Prof Dr. Stefan Decker. My thesis is about improving algorithmic transparency and explainability of black-box decision support systems with decision rules and neuro-symbolic reasoning. 

**Research Interests** 

I'm passionate about applied ML, knowledge graphs, and explainable AI (XAI). My works are mostly focused on on bioinformatics, computer vision, and NLP.
